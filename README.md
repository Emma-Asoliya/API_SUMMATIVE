This project is a summative that would determine my understanding of API's and how good i am at using them. I would be creating a weather we application that would help people finf out the weather in any country of their choice. Just like we are able to find out the time in different countries based on preference or location, my web app would do same. Making use of HTML,CSS and Javasript i would make a visually appealing and interactive website, that is easy to navigate and pleasing to view. I would also use the OpenWeatherMap API, to solve the problem and give me access to the weather in different countries of the world.
