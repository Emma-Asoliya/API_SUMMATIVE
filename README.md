This project is a summative that would determine my understanding of API's and how good i am at using them. I would be creating a weather web application that would help people find out the weather in any country of their choice. Just like we are able to find out the time in different countries based on preference or location, my web app would do same. Making use of HTML,CSS and Javasript i would make a visually appealing and interactive website, that is easy to navigate and pleasing to view. I would also use the OpenWeatherMap API, to solve the problem and give me access to the weather in different countries of the world.Although i faced some challenges with my servers and public keys i was able to fix it and make sure the right file is being shown and traffic is being distributed evenly across both servers.I got help from some classmates and also watched some videos, to learn how to deploy a website. I had cloned my repo in /var/www/html/, where index files were located along with my repo so when my web app was deployed it was host the index file from that directory instead of from my repo directory. 
i spotted the problem and was able to rectify the issue.
I vonfigured my load balancer to dstribute traffic evely across bothe servers and made sure they were seen by using theX-Served-By
